  abstract = {Introductory Transport Phenomena by R. Byron Bird, Warren E. Stewart, Edwin N. Lightfoot, and Daniel Klingenberg is a new introductory textbook based on the classic Bird, Stewart, Lightfoot text, Transport Phenomena. The authors' goal in writing this book reflects topics covered in an undergraduate course. Some of the rigorous topics suitable for the advanced students have been retained. ~  The text covers topics such as: the transport of momentum; the transport of energy and the transport of chemical species. The organization of the material is similar to Bird/Stewart/Lightfoot, but presentation has been thoughtfully revised specifically for undergraduate students encountering these concepts for the first time. ~~  Devoting more space to mathematical derivations and providing fuller explanations of mathematical developments\texthorizontalbar including a section of the appendix devoted to mathematical topics\texthorizontalbar allows students to comprehend transport phenomena concepts at an undergraduate level.},
