        When you find something you really enjoy, you will naturally focus more
        on that instead of having multiple language badges on your belt. Each
        language is different and exists for a reason. Learning to think in the
        way of programming languages is really important, and writing X code in
        Y language is the wrong way to go.

        Perform your obligatory duty, because action is better than inaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Procrastination only leads to inaction and delays our progress. It is
        important to focus on our duties and take action in the present moment.
